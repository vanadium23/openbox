**TL;DR:**

1.  **Make time to be curious**. Set aside time to let your mind wander, and journal questions you have about technology.
2.  **Imagine you are the CEO**. For any business that employs you, sketch out its business model.
3.  **Frame your career as a series of questions**. Look back on your previous roles and frame them as career questions. Then ponder what career questions you want to ask in your current role, and any future roles.
4.  **Try something new**. Choose a hobby, and try it for 30 days.
