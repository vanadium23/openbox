> make the claim in this book that we should think of software engineering in these terms:
Software engineering is the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software.

> At the root this is based in three key ideas.
>  • Science and its practical application “engineering” are vital tools in making effective progress in technical disciplines.
>  • Our discipline is fundamentally one of learning and discovery, so we need to become experts at learning to succeed, and science and engineering are how we learn most effectively.
>  • Finally, the systems that we build are often complex and are increasingly so. Meaning, to cope with their development, we need to become experts at managing that complexity.
