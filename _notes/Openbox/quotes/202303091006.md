> Typical psychologically driven behaviours that arise are: 
> - Inflated Estimates: They give estimates that are 2-3 times larger than necessary, typically to compensate for forced multi-tasking, and to have contingency “buffers” for things that inevitably “go wrong.” 
> - Sandbagging: Resistance to pass on any gained time to downstream activities, compounded with the avoidance of any additional Work Load. 
> - Student’s Syndrome: Cramming and leaving things to be done at the last moment. 
> - Parkinson’s Law: Work expands to fill the available time. 
> - Gold plating: Tendency to “polish” and “improve” completed work when finished ahead of schedule. 
> - Handover Delays: Reluctance or failure to hand over finished work.
