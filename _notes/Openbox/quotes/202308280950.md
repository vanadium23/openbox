> If any single test takes longer than an hour to run or if your software takes longer than an hour to deploy, it wonâ€™t be possible to run your tests this quickly, however much money you spend on hardware. So the testability and deployability of our system add constraints to our ability to gather feedback. We can choose to design our systems to be more easily testable and more easily deployable, allowing us to gather feedback more efficiently and over shorter time periods.
