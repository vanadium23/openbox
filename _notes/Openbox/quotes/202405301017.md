> A few years back, one of the leaders I worked with told me, “With the right people, any process works, and with the wrong people, no process works.”
I’ve found this to be pretty accurate.
Process is a tool to make it easy to collaborate, and the process that the team enjoys is usually the right process. If your process is failing somehow, it’s worth really digging into how it’s failing before you start looking for another process to replace it.
As you start homing in on the problem (maybe it’s you!), honestly ask yourself if a different process would address it, or if you’re moving around the food on your plate. My experience is that a different process probably isn’t the solution you’re looking for.
