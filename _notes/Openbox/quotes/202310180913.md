> As adults, we realize that few solutions are permanent. What would work for the child when he was four may not work for him now that he is five; what worked in the winter may not work in the spring. Life is a continual process of adjustment and readjustment. Whatâ€™s important for the child is that he continue to see himself as part of the solution rather than as part of the problem.
