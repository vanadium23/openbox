> You’ve already built one product for customers, now you’re building another: The product is your company, and your customers are your employees.
> - Building a company full of humans is more rewarding than building software, but it is also much harder.
> - Articulate your values early and often, because you will need them to avoid veering off course as you grow. (It’ll happen anyway.)
