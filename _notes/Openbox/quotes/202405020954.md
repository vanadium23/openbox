> Values are oral tradition. They tell employees a story of how to behave in both everyday and extreme situations. And they’re more efficient mediums of information than manuals and handbooks. That’s because good values stick in the brain; they’re efficient and memorable. Quite the opposite: They’re for stating the non-obvious, in non-obvious ways. They codify what you believe, putting it in a place where everyone can see—and everyone can suggest changes.
