> A good general rule around communication is to include as few people as necessary in synchronous communication (like meetings and phonecalls), and to go for a broader audience in asynchronous communication (like email, issue trackers, and document comments). Synchronous communications have a high cost: they require that participants interrupt their workday and receive information on your schedule. Asynchronous communications, however, can be dealt with at a time and place most convenient for the recipient. Every time you interrupt someone’s work it will take some amount of time for them to get back up to speeds always be conscious of when you’re doing this.
