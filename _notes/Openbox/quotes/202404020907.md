> Refine a manual valuable process before building a minimum viable product.
> - The faster the feedback loop you have with your customers, the faster you’ll get to a solution they will pay for. The fastest feedback loop will be one you have with yourself.
> - Before you build anything at all, see how little you can get away with charging for it. Even later, build only the things you need to build. Outsource the rest.
> - I define “product-market fit” as having repeat customers who sign up and use your product on their own so that you can start to focus on outbound sales.
