> your team and mine can make progress without needing to coordinate our activities, the “State of DevOps” reports say that we are more likely to be supplying high-quality code more regularly. We can achieve this in three ways. We can work with more coupled code and systems but through continuous integration and continuous delivery get fast enough feedback to identify problems quickly. We can design more decoupled systems that we can safely, with confidence, change without forcing change on others. Or we can  work with interfaces that have been agreed on and fixed so that we never change them. These are really the only strategies available. You ignore the costs of coupling, both in your software and in your organization, at your peril.
