An architect can seek to understand a teamâ€™s engineering culture by asking questions like:
- Does everyone on the team know what fitness functions are and consider the impact of new tool or product choices on the ability to evolve new fitness functions?
- Are teams measuring how well their system meets their defined fitness functions?
- Do engineers understand cohesion and coupling?
- Are there conversations about what domain and technical concepts belong together?
- Do teams choose solutions not based on what technology they want to learn, but based on its ability to make changes?
- How are teams responding to business changes? Do they struggle to incorporate small changes, or are they spending too much time on small business change?
- Adjusting the behavior of the team often involves adjusting the process around the team, as people respond to what is asked of them to do.
