> We must learn to have the confidence to begin work precisely when we don’t yet know the answers and when we don’t know how much work will be involved. This is disquieting for some people and for some organizations, but it is only the same as the reality of much of the human experience. When a business starts out on a new venture, they don’t really know when, or even whether, it will be a success. They don’t know how many people will like their ideas and whether they will be willing to pay for them.
