> In the Subversion project we had a motto: "If the discussion didn’t happen on the email list, then it never really happened." People spent lots of time bandying around ideas in chat rooms, but in order to make the resolutions "real" we had to be mindful of everyone else who didn’t witness them. By forcing conversations to repost to email lists, we gave the entire distributed team a chance to see how decisions were arrived at (and to speak up if they wanted to). This is particularly critical if you’re trying to encourage a consensus-based team culture.
