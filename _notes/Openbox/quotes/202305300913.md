> When in Rome ... The most important convention of all is that every developer should follow the old adage “When in Rome, do as the Romans do.” When working in a new file, look around to see how the existing code is structured. Are all public variables and methods declared before private ones? Are the methods in alphabetical order? Do variables use “camel case,” as in firstServerName, or “snake case,” as in first_server_name?
