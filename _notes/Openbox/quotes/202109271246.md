> Where I discuss the conservation of energy as a counterfactual principle about impossibility; three different kinds of irreversibility in physicsâ€”statistical, forgetful, and counterfactual; where I provide a counterfactual second law, based on an exact distinction between work and heat; and where you encounter the universal constructor, a machine that can perform all transformations that are physically possible.
