> And frankly, you often can’t grow faster if you try. I’ve worked sixty hours a week for years on end, and I’ve worked four hours a week. For better or worse, Gumroad grew at its own pace, and the number of hours I worked didn’t seem to have much of a correlation. I think you’ll find the same is true for you: Your company will grow as quickly as your customers determine it will grow. For us, that was 15 percent in 2017, 25 percent in 2018, 40 percent in 2019, and 87 percent year-over-year in 2020.
