> 
On paper, it seems simple enough:
> 1. Narrow down who your ideal customer is. Narrow until you can narrow no more.
> 2. Define exactly what pain point you are solving for them, and how much they will pay you to solve it.
> 3. Set a hard deadline and focus fully on building a solution, then charge for it.
> 4. Repeat the process until youâ€™ve found a product that works, then scale a business around it
