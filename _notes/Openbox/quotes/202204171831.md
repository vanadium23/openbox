The following exercise will help you state your intent and clarify your language with other people.
 
    First, choose a set of adjectives you want your users to use to describe what you're making.
    Then, choose a set of adjectives that you're okay with not being used to describe the same thing.

I find these rules helpful during this exercise:
 
    When put together, each set of words should neither repeat nor disagree with each other. The second set shouldn't be a list of opposites from the first.
    Avoid negative adjectives, like slow or bad or ugly. Keep each word as neutral as possible. A good test is that someone shouldn't be able to tell which list is positive or negative.
