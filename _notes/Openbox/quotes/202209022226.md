> Several years ago, some innovative software architects revisited the “hard to change later” problem in a new light: what if we build changeability into the architecture? In other words, if ease of change is a bedrock principle of the architecture, then change is no longer difficult. Building evolvability into architecture in turn allows a whole new set of behaviors to emerge, upsetting the dynamic equilibrium again
