> The Jeep, the Jungle and the Journey: The way “we do things around here” (the Work Process) with the team, the organization is like a Jeep. We are in control of it. We set the direction and drive. We fix and maintain it to the best of our capability. The business domain (the Work Flow) wherein the team or organization operates in is the Jungle. It is full of dangerous beasts, traps, swamps. The real challenge comes about when we actually set out to move through the Jungle - this is the Journey (the Work Execution) which will present even more unknowns and surprises.
