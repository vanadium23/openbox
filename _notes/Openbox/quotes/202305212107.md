>     - Ask yourself: “What does my behavior tell me about what my motives are?”
>     - Then, clarify what you really want. Ask yourself: “What do I want for myself? For others? For the relationship?”
>     - And finally, ask: “How would I behave if this were what I really wanted?”
> - Refuse the Sucker’s Choice
>     - Watch to see if you’re telling yourself that you must choose between peace and honesty, between winning and losing, and so on.
