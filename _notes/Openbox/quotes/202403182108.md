> Where do you start? Take a good hard look at the people, places, and communities you care about. Where are the pain points? What isn’t working, but might with a little elbow grease? These are all opportunities to make things better through minimalist entrepreneurship. It’s ironic to me how often people go around hoping to find a startup idea while simultaneously complaining about all the everyday stuff around them that doesn’t work properly. “Sure, I could solve that for people with a little effort, but the potential market just isn’t big enough to really scale.” That’s the kind of thinking that this book seeks to address.
