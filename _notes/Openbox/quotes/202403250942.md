> If you’re reading this and wondering which communities you’re already a part of, ask yourself these questions:
> - If I talk, who listens?
> - Where and with whom do I already spend my time, online and offline?
> - In what situations am I most authentically myself?
> - Who do I hang out with, even though I don’t really like them, but it’s worth it since we share something more important in common?
