> Here are some common dimensions that affect evolvability in modern software architectures:
    - **Technical** - The implementation parts of the architecture: the frameworks, dependent libraries, and the implementation language(s).
    - **Data** - Database schemas, table layouts, optimization planning, etc. The database administrator generally handles this type of architecture.
    - **Security** - Defines security policies, guidelines, and specifies tools to help uncover deficiencies.
    - **Operational/System** - Concerns how the architecture maps to existing physical and/or virtual infrastructure: servers, machine clusters, switches, cloud resources, and so on.
