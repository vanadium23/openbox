> - Flow Efficiency Board: A Board where all columns are divided in two semi-columns Waiting for… and …in Process - in order to faithfully capture the Wait Time and Touch Time components of the Flow Time. The board allows for: (1) the correct computation of Flow Efficiency; and (2) the identification of the Work Process Constraint, via the longest average in-state (i.e. column) Flow Time.
> - Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR) Board: A board where the Waiting for… semi-column of the Work Process Constraint also acts as a Buffer to support Drum-Buffer-Rope scheduling for the release of the Work Load into the Work Flow and/or Work Process.
> - TameFlow Throughput Management Board: A DBR Board that is enhanced with a limited supply of Kanban Tokens to implement a CONWIP system. It is further instrumented with Replenishment Tokens. The relative balance of Kanban Tokens and Replenishment tokens upstream and downstream of the Work Process Constraint can provide leading indicators of adverse variability affecting Flow on those parts of the Work Process before and after the Capacity of the Constraint is affected.
