> - Market Constraint: If we are able to produce more than what the market is willing to absorb and purchase, the Constraint cannot be a bottleneck in our work process, but it is the market itself.
> - Policy Constraint: Almost all companies have both explicit policies and unwritten rules of “how we do things around here.” Such policies and rules can be the real Constraint.
> - Management Attention Constraint: Executive management needs to deal with a multitude of issues; to the extent that management attention will be stretched thin and unable to focus on what really matters.
> - Mental Model Constraint: The biggest Constraint of all is our capacity of developing a deep understanding (as Deming would say) of the systems we are managing. In other words, we are constrained by our Mental Model of our reality.
