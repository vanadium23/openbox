> So catalysts are systems that can enable transformations and retain the ability to cause them again. Abstract catalysts are catalysts that are copiable and can perpetuate themselves. They are catalysts made of resilient information, which we call knowledge. Now, an intriguing fact that I am about to explain is that all catalysts must contain an abstract catalyst. Catalysts, in other words, must have some properties that are invariant, no matter what transformation they are intended for, and that invariant part must be made of knowledge. As I am about to illustrate, this remarkable fact is due to the particular structure of the laws of physics in our universe.
