> Information hiding and deep modules are closely related. If a module hides a lot of information, that tends to increase the amount of functionality provided by the module while also reducing its interface. This makes the module deeper. Conversely, if a module doesn’t hide much information, then either it doesn’t have much functionality, or it has a complex interface; either way, the module is shallow.
