> These people are idle by design. Idleness - or “slack” as it is often called - is a necessary condition for high organizational performance. It has to be accepted. What should these people do? They could literally go fishing or take a swim and enjoy life during this idle time. It would not make the slightest difference on the Throughput and it would not increase Operational Expenses. Though they really need to be ready to step right back in, as soon as their pertinent components of the next Project arrive in their columns.
