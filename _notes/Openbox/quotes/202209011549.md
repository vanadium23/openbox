> If you can’t change the system, there’s no point in continuing to put energy into changing it. Instead, put energy into leaving it: update your résumé, and start asking your close friends if they know of any openings for you at other companies. Train yourself in new things. One of the great things about being a knowledge worker in this day and age is that good ones are in high demand, and that gives you the ability to control your own future.
