> Having said that, make sure you don’t take the "design doc religion" to the opposite extreme. We’ve seen control freaks write a four-page design essay for a program that’s only 100 lines of code. If the project can be rewritten from scratch several times in the same amount of time it takes to write a design doc, a design doc is clearly a waste of time. Use experience and judgment when making these time calculations and trade-offs.
