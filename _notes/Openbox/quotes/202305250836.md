> I use a different approach to writing comments, where I write the comments at the very beginning:
> - For a new class, I start by writing the class interface comment.
> - Next, I write interface comments and signatures for the most important public methods, but I leave the method bodies empty.
> - I iterate a bit over these comments until the basic structure feels about right.
> - At this point I write declarations and comments for the most important class instance variables in the class.
> - Finally, I fill in the bodies of the methods, adding implementation comments as needed.
While writing method bodies, I usually discover the need for additional methods and instance variables. For each new method I write the interface comment before the body of the method; for instance variables I fill in the comment at the same time that I write the variable declaration
