> It’s the community that leads you to the problem, which leads you to the product, which leads you to your business.
> - Once you’ve found community-you fit, start contributing with the intention of becoming a pillar in that community.
> - Pick the right problem (it’s probably one you have), and confirm that others have it. Then confirm you have business-you fit too.
> - When in doubt, always go back to the community. They will help you keep going and ultimately succeed.
