> Industry data says that for the best software companies in the world, two-thirds of their ideas produce zero or negative value. We are terrible at guessing what our users want. Even when we ask our users, they don’t know what they want either. The most effective approach is to iterate. To accept that some, maybe even many, of our ideas will be wrong and work in a way that allows us to try them out as quickly, cheaply, and efficiently as possible.
