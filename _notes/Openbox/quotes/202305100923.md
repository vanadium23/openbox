> The best modules are those whose interfaces are much simpler than their implementations. Such modules have two advantages. First, a simple interface minimizes the complexity that a module imposes on the rest of the system. Second, if a module is modified in a way that does not change its interface, then no other module will be affected by the modification. If a moduleâ€™s interface is much simpler than its implementation, there will be many aspects of the module that can be changed without affecting other modules.
