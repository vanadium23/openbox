> I ask myself four questions every time I want to build something new:
> 1. Can I ship it in a weekend? The first iteration of most solutions can and should be prototyped in two to three days.
> 2. Is it making my customers lives a little better?
> 3. Is a customer willing to pay me for it? It’s important for the business to be profitable from day one, so creating something valuable enough for people to pay for is key.
> 4. Can I get feedback quickly? Make sure that you’re building a product for people who can let you know if you’re doing a good job or not. The faster you get feedback, the faster you’ll build something truly valuable and worth paying for.
