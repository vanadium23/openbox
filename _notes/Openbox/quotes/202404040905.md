> Even if you start low and go up over time, it is important to charge something. There is a very large difference between free and one dollar—that’s the zero price effect. As behavioral economist Dan Ariely writes in Predictably Irrational, “people will jump for something free even when it’s something they don’t want.” He uses the example of a long line of college students waiting for free, terribly unhealthy brownies. Asked to pay even just one cent, the line of kids disappears.
