> Flow Efficiency: the ratio between the total Touch Time and the end-to-end Flow Time expressed as a percentage. If no attention has been given to these ideas, Flow Efficiency is very low, especially in a knowledge work setting. Typically it is in the order of 3-7%. Yes, you read correctly! 93 to 97% of the time your work is in a still state: idle time, feedback delay time, blocked time, wait time, induced work time!
