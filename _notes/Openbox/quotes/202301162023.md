In closing, we encourage you to remember the these six points when it comes to setting SLIs and SLOs:

1.  Define SLIs and SLOs for specific capabilities at system boundaries.
2.  Each logical instance of a system (for example, a database shard) gets its own SLO.
3.  Combine SLIs for a given service into a single SLO.
4.  Document and share your SLI/SLO contracts.
5.  Assume that both your SLOs and SLIs will evolve over time.
6.  Stay engaged—SLOs represent an ongoing commitment.
