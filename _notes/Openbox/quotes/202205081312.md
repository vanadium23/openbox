> When using DDD, a Bounded Context should align one-to-one (1:1) with a single Subdomain. That is, when using DDD, if there is one Bounded Context , there is, as a goal, one Subdomain model in that Bounded Context. It may not always be possible or practical to achieve, but where possible it is important to design in that way. This will keep your Bounded Contexts clean and focused on the core strategic initiative.
