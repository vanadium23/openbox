> DRY is excellent advice within the context of a single function, service, or module.  It is good advice; beyond that, I would extend DRY to the scope of a version control repository or a deployment pipeline. It comes at a cost, though. Sometimes this is a very significant cost, when applied between services or modules, particularly if they are developed independently. if you are creating a microservice-based system, with each service being independently deployable, and so each service having its own deployment pipeline, you should not apply DRY between microservices. Don’t share code between microservices.
