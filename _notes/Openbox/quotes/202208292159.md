> Steve Jobs once said: “A people hire other A people; B people hire C people." It’s incredibly easy to fall victim to this adage, and even more so when you’re trying to hire quickly. A common approach we’ve seen is that a team needs to hire five engineers, so they sift through their pile of applications, interview 40 or 50 people, and pick the best 5 regardless of whether they meet the hiring bar. This is one of the fastest ways to build a mediocre team.
