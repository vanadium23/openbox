> Socratic questioning generally follows this process:
> - Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas. (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)
> - Challenging assumptions. (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?)
> - Looking for evidence. (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)
> - Considering alternative perspectives. (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
> - Examining consequences and implications. (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)
> - Questioning the original questions. (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)
