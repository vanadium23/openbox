> Most firms follow an OBAP model (see Figure 15.1). They first fix the organization, departments, teams, responsibilities, and so on. Then they decide on a business strategy and how to generate revenue and profit or other business outcomes, based on the constraints of those organizational decisions. Now they decide on a suitable architecture to base their systems on and finally on a process that can deliver that system architecture. This is kind of crazy: the business vision and goals are constrained by organizational structure! A more sensible model is to treat the structure of our organizations as a tool, BAPO. First we identify business vision and goals, then we decide how we could achieve that technically (architecture), then we figure out how we could build something like that (process), and finally we pick an organizational structure that will support the necessary activities.
