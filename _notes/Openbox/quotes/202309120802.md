> Now neither I nor Dan have any data to back up this idea, but it is an interesting one. He says that the quality of the software produced by a team is a function of its software half-life, that is, the time that it takes the team to rewrite half of the software that they are responsible for. In Danâ€™s model, good teams will probably rewrite half the software that they are responsible for in months; low-performing teams may never rewrite half.
