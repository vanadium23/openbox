> Good goals are a composition of four specific kinds of numbers:
> - A target states where you want to reach.
> - A baseline identifies where you are today.
> - A trend describes the current velocity.
> - - A time frame sets bounds for the change.

> Put these all together, and a well-structured goal takes the form of: “In Q3, we will reduce time to render our frontpage from 600ms (p95) to 300ms (p95). In Q2, render time increased from 500ms to 600ms.” The best way to avoid such unintended outcomes is to pair your investment goals with baseline metrics, sometimes referred to as countervailing metrics.
