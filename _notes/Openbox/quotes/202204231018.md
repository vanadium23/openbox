1. Write down the meaning of the term as simply as you can.
2. Underline each term within your definition that needs to be further defined.
3. Define those terms and test your definition with someone who doesn't know those terms yet.
4. Look at each individual word and ask yourself: What does this mean? Is it as simple as possible?
