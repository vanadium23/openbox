> When you have a tough message to share, or when you are so convinced of your own rightness that you may push too hard, remember to STATE your path:
> - Share your facts. Start with the least controversial, most persuasive elements from your Path to Action.
> - Tell your story. Explain what you’re beginning to conclude.
> - Ask for others’ paths. Encourage others to share both their facts and their stories.
> - Talk tentatively. State your story as a story—don’t disguise it as a fact.
> - Encourage testing. Make it safe for others to express differing or even opposing views.
