> When building software, architects must determine the most important of these “-ilities.” However, many of these factors oppose one another. For example, achieving both high performance and extreme scalability can be difficult because achieving both requires a careful balance of architecture, operations, and many other factors. As a result, the necessary analysis in architecture design and the inevitable clash of competing factors requires balance, but balancing the pros and cons of each architectural decision leads to the tradeoffs so commonly lamented by architects
