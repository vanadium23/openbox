> For example, organizations made up of high-performing teams, based on this model, make more money than orgs that don’t. Here is data that says that there is a correlation between a development approach and the commercial outcome for the company that practices it. It also goes on to dispel a commonly held belief that “you can have either speed or quality but not both.” This is simply not true. Speed and quality are clearly correlated in the data from this research. The route to speed is high-quality software, the route to high-quality software is speed of feedback, and the route to both is great engineering.
