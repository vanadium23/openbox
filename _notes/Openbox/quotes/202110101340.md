> My initial plan was to study one chapter per day. That included solving all the questions presented in that chapter. I timeboxed myself to one hour per question. If I weren’t able to solve it, I’d come back to it the next day. If, on the second day, I couldn’t make progress on the question, I’d sneak a peek at the answer. I would make sure that I’m understanding the solution and not just memorizing it.
