> In summary, so far we have learned that to produce an effective performance improvement, we need to do the following: 
> 1. Limit Work in Process and Postpone Commitment. 
> 2. Reduce Wait Times (inside the process) and improve Flow Efficiency without changing the Work Processes, nor sustaining any Investments nor higher Operating Expenses. The risk of failure is practically non-existent, because the only thing that changes is the decision about when to start new work. 
> 3. Reduce Touch Time only if you are absolutely sure that you are doing so on the Constraint of the system. Reducing Touch Time means operating in new ways. The Work Processes will have to change. You will have to sustain both initial investments as well as higher operating expenses. If you reduce Touch Time on any Non-Constraint, the effect will be negligible and most likely negative. (And the only exception is if that reduction is done to support the improvement on the Constraint.)
