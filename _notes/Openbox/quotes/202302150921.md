> We really want work to be queued in a waiting line outside the system until it can be worked on and serviced with no interruptions once it enters the system. The situation is similar to what happens when we stand in line for a burger at McDonaldâ€™s or a ride at Disneyland. It is a common experience - and a Mental Model - that we wait in line until our turn comes. We should ponder over why the fast food and entertainment industries understand this very well, while this is all forgotten in knowledge intensive businesses.
