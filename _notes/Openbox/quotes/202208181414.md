> Five simple rules for running a meeting: 1. Only invite people who absolutely need to be there. 2. Have an agenda and distribute it well before the meeting starts. 3. End the meeting early if you’ve accomplished the meeting’s goals. 4. Keep the meeting on track. 5. Try to schedule the meeting near other interrupt points in your day(e.g., lunch, end of day).
