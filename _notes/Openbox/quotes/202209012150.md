We’ve covered a slew of ideas in this chapter, but in the end, it all boils down to three simple concepts that you can stick in your pocket:
- Marketing
    - Be aware of how people perceive your software; it determines whether they even try it out.
- Product design
    - If your software isn’t easy to try, fast, friendly, and accessible, users will walk away.
- Customer service
    - Proactive engagement with long-term users affects your software’s evolution and user retention.
