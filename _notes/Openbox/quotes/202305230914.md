> Comments can fill in missing details such as:
> - What are the units for this variable?
> - Are the boundary conditions inclusive or exclusive?
> - If a null value is permitted, what does it imply?
> - If a variable refers to a resource that must eventually be freed or closed, who is responsible for freeing or closing it?
> - Are there certain properties that are always true for the variable (invariants), such as “this list always contains at least one entry”?
