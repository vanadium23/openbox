Humility 
    You are not the center of the universe. You’re neither omniscient nor infallible. You’re open to self-improvement. 
Respect 
    You genuinely care about others you work with. You treat them as human beings, and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments. 
Trust 
    You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and you’re OK with letting them drive when appropriate.[5]
