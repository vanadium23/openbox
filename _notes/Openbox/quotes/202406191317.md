> THINK ABOUT THIS
How to know whether you are looking at a system or just a bunch of stuff:
A ) Can you identify parts? . . . and
B) Do the parts affect each other? . . . and
C) Do the parts together produce an effect that is different from the effect of each part on its own? . . . and perhaps
D) Does the effect, the behavior over time, persist in a variety of circumstances?
