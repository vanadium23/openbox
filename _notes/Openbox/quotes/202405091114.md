> The first one is what Wall Street traders would call “upside optionality”, that is, seeking out situations that we expect have good odds of offering us opportunities. Take the example of attending a cocktail party where a lot of people you might like to know are in attendance. While nothing is guaranteed to happen—you may not meet those people, and if you do, it may not go well— you give yourself the benefit of serendipity and randomness. The worst thing that can happen is...nothing. One thing you know for sure is that you’ll never meet them sitting at home. By going to the party, you improve your odds of encountering opportunity.
