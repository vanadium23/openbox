> Even small improvements in latency matter when you’re serving a web-based application. Suppose it takes 750 milliseconds for your main application screen to load. That seems fast enough, right? Not too frustrating for any given user. But if you could slash your load times to 250 milliseconds, that extra half of a second makes a huge difference in aggregate. If you have a million users each doing 20 requests per day, that amounts to 116 years of saved user time—stop killing your users! Improving latency is one of the best ways to increase usage and make your users happy. As Google’s founders like to say, "Speed is a feature."
