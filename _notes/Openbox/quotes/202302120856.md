> At times the original language used in the Theory of Constraints might not seem very considerate to human needs, and some react negatively just because words like “exploit” and “subordinate” are used. If one prefers, there is also the 5FS acronym FOCUS by David V Hodes: (1) Find the Constraint; (2) Optimize the Constraint; (3) Collaborate around the Constraint; (4) Uplift the Constraint; and (5) Start again! - In any case, no matter what choice of language one does, what matters are the underlying concepts and the thinking behind the 5FS.
