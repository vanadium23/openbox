> It took six months, but I eventually found and fixed the bug. The problem was actually quite simple (as are most bugs, once you figure them out). The file system code used the variable name block for two different purposes. In some situations, block referred to a physical block number on disk; in other situations, block referred to a logical block number within a file. Unfortunately, at one point in the code there was a block variable containing a logical block number, but it was accidentally used in a context where a physical block number was needed; as a result, an unrelated block on disk got overwritten with zeroes.
