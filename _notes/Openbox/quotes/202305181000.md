> The correlation of a filter of length m with a source signal1 of length n, where m is odd (given by 2p + 1), is a signal1 of length n obtained by sliding the filter from overlap position −p to overlap position n − p − 1, where each segment of the result signal1 is obtained by taking the dot product of the filter and the overlap in the source at each overlap position.
