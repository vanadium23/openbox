> But massacre is not prevented by sticking to gunpowder; the Thirty Years War is proof of that. Massacre is prevented by the scientist’s ethic, and the poet’s, and every creator’s: that the end for which we work exists and is judged only by the means which we use to reach it. This is the human sum of the values of science. It is the basis of a society which scrupulously seeks knowledge to match and govern its power. But it is not the scientist who can govern society; his duty is to teach it the implications and the values in his work.
