> Avoid Integration Train Wrecks When a client Bounded Context (C1) integrates with a service Bounded Context (S1), C1 should usually not be making a synchronous, blocking request to S1 as a direct result of handling a request made to it. That is, while some other client (C0) makes a blocking request to C1, donâ€™t allow C1 to make a blocking request to S1. Doing so has a very high potential for causing an integration train wreck between C0, C1, and S1. This can be avoided by using asynchronous messaging.
