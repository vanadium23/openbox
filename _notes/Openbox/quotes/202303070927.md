> Note: Is it minimum or minimal? All the above terms can also be found with the adjective “minimum” instead of “minimal.” In the end, the choice of word does not matter if we understand the purpose and intent of the underlying concepts and notions; therefore, it boils down to a matter of preference. While in the past we have used the term “minimum,” we now actually prefer “minimal.” The reason is that while “minimum” refers to the smallest possible amount or quantity, “minimal” conveys the meaning of sufficiency, something that is absolutely adequate, suitable, acceptable, and fit for purpose, yet is as small as possible, and no smaller and no bigger. It is this latter meaning that we prefer to capture. Hence “minimal”.
