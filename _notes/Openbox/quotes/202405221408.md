> This is just one example of the dynamics that play out across many dimensions when you’re considering introducing a new authority, and the most useful framework I’ve found for thinking through this involves positive and negative freedoms. A positive freedom is the freedom to do something, for example the freedom to pick a programming language you prefer. A negative freedom is the freedom from things happening to you, for example the freedom not to be obligated to support additional programming languages, even if others would greatly prefer them.
