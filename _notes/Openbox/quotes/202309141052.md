> This is a simple model for software engineering, but one that it is difficult to apply. It is simple in that there are ten fundamental ideas in two groups and then a few tools like testability, deployability, speed, controlling the variables, and continuous delivery that can help us to achieve those fundamentals, and that is all that there is. However, the implications of these ten things are often thought-provoking and complex so that can make them difficult to apply.
