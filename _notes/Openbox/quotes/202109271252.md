> The chemist Peter Atkins has frequently said, in his masterly books about the foundations of thermodynamics, that work and heat are not ‘substances’ (just as information is not a substance). They refer to modes of transfers of energy. I call the reversible transfers work-like (the transferred energy that can be reused ad infinitum, to initiate or to stop controlled, ordered kinds of motion); I call the irreversible transfers heat-like. The second law requires some energy transfers to be heat-like: once they happen, it is impossible to recycle some of the energy involved in them. That energy can no longer be used fully for a work-like transfer; only some of it can.
