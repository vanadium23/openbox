> There are five linked behaviors in this category:
  • Working iteratively
  • Employing fast, high-quality feedback
  • Working incrementally
  • Being experimental
  • Being empirical
If you have not thought about this before, these five practices may seem abstract and rather divorced from the day-to-day activities of software development, let alone software engineering.
