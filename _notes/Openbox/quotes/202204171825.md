> To determine who matters, ask these questions:
 
    Who's most important to get agreement from?
    Who's most important to serve?
    What words might make them defensive?
    What words might put them at ease?
    How open are they to change?
    How will this affect their lives?
    How does the current state of things look to them? Is that good or bad?
