>
 >   - Who's most important to get agreement from?
 >   - Who's most important to serve?
 >   - What words might make them defensive?
 >   - What words might put them at ease?
 >   - How open are they to change?
  >  - How will this affect their lives?
  >  - How does the current state of things look to them? Is that good or bad?
