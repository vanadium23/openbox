**TL;DR: ** For the "direct" call, the overhead of functional options is low: a few extra nanoseconds per call. However, when calling via an interface, the compiler is required to heap allocate the slice argument, so the functional options version is about 5Ã— slower. The difference gets even larger as more options are passed.
