Soon, there was no ground cover, and the soil was eroding, and it was fucking up waterways, and all sorts of other species were thrown out of whack because of it. A huge mess. But if you think about it from the elks‚Äô perspective, this is the greatest thing that ever happened. The whole reason they never went into those fields before is because they were afraid. They lived under constant fear of a wild dog jumping out and eating them or their young at any moment. That is an awful way to live. It must have been such a relief to be free of predators and eat whatever the hell you wanted. But that was the exact opposite of what the ecosystem needed. The ecosystem required the elk to be afraid in order to stay in balance. But elk don‚Äôt want to be afraid. Fear is miserable, as is pain. As is hunger. Every animal is hardwired to do absolutely anything to stop those feelings as fast as possible. We‚Äôre all just trying to be comfortable, and well fed, and unafraid. It wasn‚Äôt the elk‚Äôs fault. The elk just wanted to relax.‚Äù Dex nodded at the ruined factory. ‚ÄúAnd the people who made places like this weren‚Äôt at fault either‚Äîat least, not at first. They just wanted to be comfortable.
