Start measuring your team‚Äôs health (maybe using short, monthly surveys) and your team‚Äôs throughput (do some lightweight form of task sizing, even if you just do it informally with a senior engineer on the team or with yourself), which will allow you to establish the baseline before your change. Then just start running kanban. Don‚Äôt publicize it, don‚Äôt make a big deal about it, just start doing it with your team. Frame it as a short experiment with the team, and start trying it. Keep iterating on it until you‚Äôre confident it works. Have the courage to keep at it for a while, and also the courage to stop doing it if it doesn‚Äôt work after a month or two. Use the team‚Äôs health and throughput metrics to ground your decision about whether it‚Äôs working. Document. After you‚Äôve discovered an effective approach, document the problem you set out to solve, the learning process you went through, and the details of how another team would adopt the practice for themselves. Be as detailed as possible: make a canonical document, and even get a few folks on other teams to check that it‚Äôs readable from their perspective. Share. The final step is to share your documented approach, along with your experience doing the rollout, in a short email. Don‚Äôt ask everyone to adopt the practice, don‚Äôt lobby for change, just present the approach and your experience following it. You‚Äôll spend the majority of your time refining approaches that work effectively for your team, a bit of your time documenting how you did it, and almost no time trying to convince folks to change their approach. Strangely, in my experience, this has often led to more adoption than top-down mandates have." />
