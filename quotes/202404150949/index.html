<meta name="description" content="There are two kinds of costs. The first is variable cost, also referred to as the ‚Äúcost of goods sold,‚Äù or COGS: the cost associated with selling each marginal unit of product. In brick-and-mortar businesses, that includes costs like labor, packaging, raw materials, and more. For software businesses in the 1990s, COGS were non-zero because software was put onto CDs and sold in retail stores. Things have changed a lot since then. ‚ÄúShipping‚Äù some electrons over the internet is virtually free, and the internet makes it much cheaper to collect payments online. For example, for each dollar we earn at Gumroad, we incur about 40 cents of variable costs. This 40 percent consists of payment processing fees, web hosting costs, other infrastructure costs, and fraud prevention (a necessary evil of helping people transact online). That leaves us 60 cents per dollar. But that 60 cents isn‚Äôt pure profit‚Äîwe still need to pay the second kind of costs, fixed costs, which don‚Äôt scale linearly with our revenue and each incremental product sold.

The number one fixed cost is people.
