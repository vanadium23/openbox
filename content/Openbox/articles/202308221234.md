**TL;DR**: набор практик для масштабирования [[Openbox/competencies/software architecture|software architecture]] в рамках компании
* One core element: Advice Process
- Four supporting elements:
    - Architecture Advisory Forum
    - Lightweight [[Openbox/Architecture Decision Record|ADR]]s
    - Team-sourced Principles
    - Your own Tech Radar

The Advice Process is the core element of this anarchist, decentralised approach to architecture. It’s greatest quality is it’s remarkably simplicity. It comprises one rule, and one qualifier:

- **The Rule:** anyone can make an architectural decision.
- **The Qualifier:** before making the decision, the decision-taker must consult two groups: The first is everyone who will be meaningfully affected by the decision. The second is people with expertise in the area the decision is being taken.

That’s it. That’s the Advice Process in its entirety.

The standing agenda typically begins as follows:

- team representatives quickly share new [spikes](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html) (giving early warning of probable future decisions and allow the attendees to share existing knowledge and experience)
- discussions about each new “proposed” decision (presented by those making the decision, captured ahead of time in the form of an ADR)
- a re-visit of other decision-statuses (we timebox these, both to limit the window for incoming advice, and also to allow us to revisit a decision which we made with imperfect information)
- a look at our collective four key metrics, our cloud spend trends, and finally
- any other business (aka “AOB”)
