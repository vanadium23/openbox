**TL;DR**:
- хорошее именование позволяет не заглядывать в реализацию
- плохой нейминг увеличивает когнитивную нагрузку

What does that look like? Something like this:

- You're reading through the code in some file. Line one, line two, line three.
- You reach line 30 and see `getThePosts`.
- You realize that `getThePosts` must be getting some posts, but you don't know which ones. So you have to scroll to line 174 where `getThePosts` is defined.
- On line 174 you start reading through `getThePosts`. Once you reach line 210, you realize that it is getting _promoted_ posts. Cool!
- Now you scroll back up to line 30. You realize that `getThePosts` is giving you promoted posts, but you forgot what was happening before line 30. Damn. So now you have to go back to line 10 or 15 to remind yourself what was going on in the first place.
