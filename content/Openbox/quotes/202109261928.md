So here is the main conclusion of this discussion. A quantum information medium is a system with the following counterfactual properties:

    It has at least two information variables (such as P and PS) that are impossible to copy simultaneously to arbitrarily high accuracy (non-copiability of information variables).

    It must be possible to reverse all the transformations involving these variables (reversibility).
