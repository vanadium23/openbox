> Agile approaches are not flawless, especially when it comes to high performing organizations (rather than simply teams). The main argument for this is that the feedback loops between what happens on the ground and the higher levels of management are too long and too slow. Additionally, the information brought to top management is often not timely enough or accurate enough for them to support operational decisions that are relevant, actionable and timely. In other words, Agile approaches, while being excellent at improving operations at the team level, do not include top management. In fact, it is almost a stereotypical truth that Agile approaches are seen as anti-management.
