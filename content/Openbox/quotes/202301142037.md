> Here are some ways to manage performance:
    -   Ask for the results you want.
    -   Ask the team to work together to produce features.
    -   Create communities of practice to help people learn their craftsmanship.
    -   Provide the team members with the knowledge of how to provide feedback and coaching to each other.
    -   As a manager, you provide meta-coaching and meta-feedback to team members. (The team members [provide each other feedback](https://www.jrothman.com/articles/2012/10/building-a-team-through-feedback-2/) and coaching, managing their daily performance.)
