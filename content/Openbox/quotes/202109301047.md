> In terms of preventing this phenomenon from corrupting a software group, here is a list of things that can help:

1.  Give team members as much creative freedom as possible to let them showcase their approaches (and remember that you learn more from failures than successes).
2.  Provide incentives or rewards for learning a new language, approach, framework, pattern, style, etc.
3.  Avoid ever using number of years in the field or with the company as a justification for favoring or accepting anyone’s argument as superior.
4.  Put policies in place that force external perspectives into the company (lunch-and-learns, monthly training, independent audits, etc).
5.  Whenever possible, resolve disputes/disagreements with objective measures rather than subjective considerations like seniority or democratic vote.
6.  Create a “culture of proof”–opinions don’t matter unless they’re supported with independent accounts, statistics, facts, etc.
7.  Do a periodic poll of employees, junior and senior, and ask them to list a few of their strengths and an equal number of things they know nothing about or would like to know more about. This is to deflate ahead of time an air of “know-it-all-ism” around anyone–especially tenured team members.
