 in increasing order of effectiveness:
12. Numbers: Constants and parameters such as subsidies, taxes, and standards
11. Buffers: The sizes of stabilizing stocks relative to their flows
10. Stock-and-Flow Structures: Physical systems and their nodes of intersection
9. Delays: The lengths of time relative to the rates of system changes
8. Balancing Feedback Loops: The strength of the feedbacks relative to the impacts they are trying to correct
7. Reinforcing Feedback Loops: The strength of the gain of driving loops
6. Information Flows: The structure of who does and does not have access to information
5. Rules: Incentives, punishments, constraints 4. Self-Organization: The power to add, change, or evolve system structure
3. Goals: The purpose of the system
2. Paradigms: The mind-set out of which the system—its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters—arises
1. Transcending Paradigms
