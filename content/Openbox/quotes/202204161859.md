To start to identify the mess you're facing, work through these questions:

- Users: Who are your intended users? What do you know about them? How can you get to know them better? How might they describe this mess?
- Stakeholders: Who are your stakeholders? What are their expectations? What are their thoughts about this mess? How might they describe it?
- Information: What interpretations are you dealing with? What information is being created through a lack of data or content?
- Current state: Are you dealing with too much information, not enough information, not the right information, or a combination of these?
