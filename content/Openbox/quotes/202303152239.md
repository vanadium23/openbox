> Согласен! Я в целом думаю про LLMs через такие категории:

1) Dummy tasks: speeding up the process of creating text work products that don’t require new info / inventing anything but only reformating/repurposing knowledge and info that already exists — from emails to (most SEO-oriented) blogs to code completions to lesson plan on subject X, ad infinitum.

2) Fiction: it’s really good at blending concepts (e.g., generate names for [bday party dishes] in [harry potter style], write a play about [ants] in [a different galaxy]), albeit great fiction — think LOTR, Harry Potter, etc. — requires a profound understanding of the world that these models don’t have; fiction also doesn’t require truthfulness / fact check

3) Presenting existing knowledge/info in new and convenient ways: teaching, tutors, factual q&a, etc. — google struggles with complex, multi-variable questions like “what is the difference between top_p and temperature in OpenAI API” (the more variables, the less chances you will find what you need)

4) Working with documents of all sorts: taxes GPT-4 demo, semantic search, summarization, conversion, transformation, etc. — again, existing info
