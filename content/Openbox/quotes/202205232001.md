> The key to learning from your mistakes is to document your failures. Write up "postmortems," as they’re often called in our business. Take extra care to make sure the postmortem document isn’t just a useless list of apologies or excuses—that’s not its purpose. A proper postmortem should always contain an explanation of what was learned and what the learning experience.
