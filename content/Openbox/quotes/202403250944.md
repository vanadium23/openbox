> If youâ€™re struggling here (many do), some Economics 101 may help. There are only four different types of utility: place utility, form utility, time utility, and possession utility. What can you make easier to understand, faster to get, cheaper to buy, or more accessible to others?
> * Place utility: Make something inaccessible accessible
> * Form utility: Make something more valuable by rearranging existing parts
> * Time utility: Make something slow go fast
> * Possession utility: Remove a middleman
