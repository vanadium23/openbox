> Here are the most important software design principles discussed in this book:
> - Complexity is incremental: you have to sweat the small stuff (see p. 11).
> - Working code isn’t enough (see p. 14).
> - Make continual small investments to improve system design (see p. 15).
> - Modules should be deep (see p. 22)
> - Interfaces should be designed to make the most common usage as simple as possible (see p. 27).
> - It’s more important for a module to have a simple interface than a simple implementation (see pp. 55, 71).
> - General-purpose modules are deeper (see p. 39).
> - Separate general-purpose and special-purpose code (see p. 62).
> - Different layers should have different abstractions (see p. 45).
> - Pull complexity downward (see p. 55).
> - Define errors (and special cases) out of existence (see p. 79).
> - Design it twice (see p. 91).
> - Comments should describe things that are not obvious from the code (see p. 101).
> - Software should be designed for ease of reading, not ease of writing (see p. 149).
> - The increments of software development should be abstractions, not features (see p. 154).
