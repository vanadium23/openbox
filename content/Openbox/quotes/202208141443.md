> The concepts of value are profound and difficult exactly because they do two things at once: they join men into societies, and yet they preserve for them a freedom which makes them single men. A philosophy which does not acknowledge both needs cannot evolve values, and indeed cannot allow them. This is true of a wholly social philosophy such as dialectical materialism, in which the community lays down how the individual must act; there is no room for him to ask himself how he ought to act. And it is equally true of the individualist systems which have for some time had a following in England - systems such as logical positivism and its modern derivative, analytical philosophy.
