> Here’s a hard truth: unless you’re developing software tools, engineers are not the audience of your software. The corollary is that you, as an engineer, are a terrible evaluator of your software’s usability. An interface that seems totally reasonable to you may very likely make your nontechie neighbor pull out her hair in frustration.
If we assume that "successful software" means "lots of people use and love your software," you need to pay deep attention to your users. Google has a famous motto:
Focus on the user, and all else will follow.
