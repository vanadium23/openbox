> I have said that most transformations that are possible in the physical world must occur via a catalyst that enables them. I have also noted that all catalysts must contain an abstract catalyst, which is itself made of knowledge, as introduced in chapter 1. Knowledge is defined entirely via counterfactuals: it is information that is capable of remaining instantiated in physical systems.
