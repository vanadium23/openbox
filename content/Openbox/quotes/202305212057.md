>But how? How do you recognize what has happened to you, stop playing games, and then influence your own motives? ... Stop and ask yourself some questions that return you to dialogue. You can ask these questions either when you find yourself slipping out of dialogue or as reminders when you prepare to step up to a crucial conversation. Here are some great ones:
> - What do I really want for myself?
> - What do I really want for others?
> - What do I really want for the relationship?
> Once youâ€™ve asked yourself what you want, add one more equally telling question: How would I behave if I really wanted these results?
