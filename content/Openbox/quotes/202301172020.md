> I think this concept extends even farther, to applications of all kinds: big, small, web, GUIs, console applications, you name it. I've often said that **a well-designed system makes it easy to do the right things and annoying (but not impossible) to do the wrong things**. If we design our applications properly, our users should be inexorably drawn into the pit of success. Some may take longer than others, but they should all get there eventually.
