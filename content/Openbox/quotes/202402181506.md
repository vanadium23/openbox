> In a word, optionality. The mere presence of a system behaving a certain way changes the desire for how the system should behave (Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle). However much you’d pay for the $10/$1 machine, you’d pay more for one that could turn into either a $100/$10 machine or a $20/$1 machine—even if you didn’t know which it would turn into. This is the secret it took me decades to absorb. I didn’t have to change the behavior of my system to make it more valuable. As soon as I added to the options of what it could do next, I had already made money. (I went down the rabbit hole of options pricing formulas to really cement this understanding, but I trust you to figure out how to convince yourself.)
