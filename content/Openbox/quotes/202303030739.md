> Note: Some astute readers might also make this reflection. Flow Efficiency boards better represent the Value Stream of most processes. When you arrive at a restaurant or at a hospital you are not put in a Doing state upon arrival. First you identify yourself according to some procedure; then you Wait and only after a while are you In Process. Conventional Kanban Board design seems detached from that reality.
