> The subject of this book is the evolution of contemporary values. My theme is that the values which we accept today as permanent and often as self-evident have grown out of the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution. The arts and the sciences have changed the values of the Middle Ages; and this change has been an enrichment, moving towards what makes us more deeply human. This theme plainly outrages a widely held view of what science does. If, as many think, science only compiles an endless dictionary of facts, then it must be neutral (and neuter) as a machine is; it cannot bear on human values. But of course science is not a giant dictionary, any more than literature is; both are served by, they do not serve, the makers of their dictionaries.
