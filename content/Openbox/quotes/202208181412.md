> If you’re trying to design something new, try to include no more than five people in your meeting - it’s practically impossible to come up with new designs and make decisions with more than five people in a room unless there’s only one person in the room making the decisions. If you don’t believe us, get five of your friends together,go downtown, and try to decide among the six of you how to do a walking tour that hits half a dozen tourist sites. The odds are good that you’ll stand on the street corner arguing for most of the day unless you simply declare one person to be the final arbiter and the follow her wherever she goes.
