> command is different from a Domain Event in that a command can be rejected as inappropriate in some cases, such as due to supply and availability of some resources (product, funds, etc.), or another kind of business-level validation. So, a command may be rejected, but a Domain Event is a matter of history and cannot logically be denied. Even so, in response to a time-based Domain Event it could be that the application will need to generate one or more commands in order to ask the application to carry out some set of actions.
