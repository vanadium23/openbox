> Admitting you’ve made a mistake or you’re simply out of your league is a way to increase your status over the long run. In fact, it encompasses all of HRT: it’s an outward show of humility, it’s about accountability and taking responsibility, it’s a signal that you trust others' opinions, and in return, people end up respecting your honesty and strength. Sometimes the best thing you can do is just say, "I don’t know."
