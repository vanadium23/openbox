> However, not all lactobacillus strains are alike, and some create a more desirable flavor than others, so when a baker finds a starter (i.e., a bacteria culture/yeast mixture) that gives a really great sourdough flavor, she’ll take care to maintain and grow the same bacterial culture by adding more flour and water to it. She’ll then take small amounts of the starter and inoculate the ingredients for a loaf of bread, and voilà, she’s got a great loaf of sourdough! This works because the culture in the starter not only creates the taste that she wants, but is strong enough to overtake any other wild strains of yeast or bacteria that might be in the bread ingredients or the air of the bakery.
