> Typically, Mental Models are tacit and are assumed to be understood the same way or shared by others. Miscommunication is often the result of people not sharing the same Mental Models. Most Mental Models are also flawed, because: 
> 1. Mental Models offer an imperfect interpretation of reality. Hence, one strategy to improve the quality of our decision making, is to explicitly focus on better, context-appropriate Mental Models and on making sure that they are well articulated, shared and used by all people in our organization to frame whatever their object of attention might be. 
> 2. Mental Models are often based on wrong assumptions. Once such assumptions are exposed and reconsidered, then new, more powerful Mental Models can be derived. They are often bewilderingly simple, to the point that they will seem obvious.
