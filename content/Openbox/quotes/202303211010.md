> If a Bubble Fever Chart has a majority of MOVEs in the red zone, then it is most likely a signal of system overload. It should appear once or twice, and then disappear once top management really addresses the issues. However, if the “redness” persists, it could also be an indication that the size of the Buffers are too small or the MOVEs are too big. In this case, top management just has to change their expectations; and accept that the teams have to be given more time to do a proper job for that level of Work Load. The alternative of reducing Work in Process (which sometimes is hard especially when many things need to be ready by a deadline) is to take more time.
