> In general, we should treat reversible decisions differently than irreversible decisions. There’s great value in reviewing, double-checking, triple-checking irreversible decisions. The pace should be slow and deliberate. Even if there is a great upside to the decision, there is also potentially a great downside if we get it wrong. Yes, we want the upside, but even more we want to avoid the downside. How about reversible decisions? Most software design decisions are easily reversible. There is some upside to making them (making behavior changes easier, as we’ve seen throughout this book). But there’s really not much downside, because we can so easily reverse a decision if it turns out to be wrong. Because there is so little value to avoiding mistakes, we shouldn’t invest much in doing so. That’s the economic reality I was hinting at when choosing “tidying” to describe what we’re doing in this book. It’s no big deal. Just tidying.
