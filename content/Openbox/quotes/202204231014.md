To refine your ontology, all you need is a pile of sticky notes, a pen, and some patience.
 
1. Find a flat or upright surface to work on.
2. Write a term or concept that relates to your work on each sticky note.
3. Put the sticky notes onto the surface as they relate to each other. 
4. Start to create structures and relationships based on their location.

Ontology always exists, but the one you have today may be messy or nonsensical.
