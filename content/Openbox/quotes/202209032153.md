One beneficial side effect of habitually building new features using feature toggles is the ability to perform QA tasks in production. Many companies don’t realize they can use their production environment for exploratory testing. Once a team becomes comfortable using feature toggles, they can deploy those changes to production since most feature toggle frameworks allow developers to route users based on wide variety of criteria (IP address, access control list (ACL), etc.). If a team deploys new features within feature toggles to which only the QA department has access, they can test in production.
