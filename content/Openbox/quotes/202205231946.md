> For example, do you always feel like you need to have the first or last word on every subject? Do you feel the need to comment on every detail in a proposal or discussion? Or do you know somebody who does these things? Note that "being humble" is not the same as saying one should be an utter doormat: there’s nothing wrong with self-confidence. Just don’t come off like a know-it-all. Even better, think about going for a "collective" ego instead; rather than worrying about whether you’re personally awesome, try to build a sense of team accomplishment and group pride.
