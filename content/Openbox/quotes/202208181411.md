> Anything worth deeper discussion should take place after the meeting,with only the relevant people sticking around for it. This is also a great way to avoid derailing a meeting when someone starts to do a deep dive into a particular meeting topic: the person running the meeting should just add the topic to a list of "sidebars" and once the meeting is over, review them one at a time. If your team makes this a habit, it’s easy to call "sidebar" on something that’s getting off track without putting anyone off.
