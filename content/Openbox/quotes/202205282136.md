> Declines, however, are much more subtle. People think that companies die with a big bang and a crash. However, this is rarely true. Often death manifests as a slow nosedive into capitulation and irrelevance. Leadership struggles to set direction, lose key staff in crucial business functions, and don't seem to break ground. Progress comes to a halt. You see these signs, head for the exit immediately.
