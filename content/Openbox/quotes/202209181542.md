> We encourage architects to start thinking of all kinds of architectural verification mechanisms as fitness functions, including things they have previously considered ad hoc. For example, many architectures have a service-level agreement around scalability and corresponding tests. They also have rules around security requirements, with accompanying verification mechanisms. Architects often think of these as separate categories, but both intents are the same: verify some feature of the architecture. By thinking of all architectural verification as fitness functions, there is more consistency when automation and other beneficial synergistic interactions are defined.
