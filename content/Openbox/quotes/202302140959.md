> One key tenet of the TameFlow Approach is that to achieve superior organizational performance, we must create the conditions of Unity of Purpose - otherwise our people will be pulling in different directions and waste energy and time simply fighting one another. The deeper insight here is that if we want to attain such Unity of Purpose, then all actors on our scene must share the same Mental Models. The prime directive for top management thus becomes: decide which Mental Models are relevant, and then make sure that all your people fully subscribe to them.
