> First, of course, comes independence, in observation and thence in thought. I once told an audience of school-children that the world would never change if they did not contradict their elders. I was chagrined to find next morning that this axiom outraged their parents. Yet it is the basis of the scientific method. A man must see, do, and think things for himself, in the face of those who are sure that they have already been over all that ground. In science, there is no substitute for independence.
