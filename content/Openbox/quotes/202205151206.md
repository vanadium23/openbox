- Humility 
    - You are not the center of the universe. You’re neither omniscient nor infallible. You’re open to self-improvement. 
- Respect 
    - You genuinely care about others you work with. You treat them as human beings, and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments. 
- Trust
    - You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and you’re OK with letting them drive when appropriate.[5]
