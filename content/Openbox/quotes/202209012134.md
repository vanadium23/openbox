> To illustrate, take a look at popular scripting languages. A majority of programmers will espouse that Perl or Python is a "better" language than PHP. They’ll claim that Perl/Python/Ruby programs are easier to read and maintain over the long run, have more mature libraries, and are inherently safer and more secure when exposed to the open Web. Yet PHP is far more popular—at least for web development. Why? Because any high school student can just pick it up through osmosis by copying his buddy’s website. There’s no need to read books, do extensive tutorials, or learn serious programming patterns. It’s conducive to tinkering: just start hacking on your site and figure out different PHP tricks from your peers.
