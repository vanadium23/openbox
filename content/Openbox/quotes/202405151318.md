> Itâ€™s not just training and hiring, though:
> - For every additional order of magnitude of engineers, you need to design and maintain a new layer of management.
> - For every ~10 engineers, you need an additional team, which requires more coordination.14
> - Each engineer means more commits and deployments per day, creating load on your development tools.
> - Most outages are caused by deployments, so more deployments drive more outages, which in turn require incident management, mitigations, and postmortems.
> - Having more engineers leads to more specialized teams and systems, which require increasingly small on-call rotations so that your on-call engineers have enough system context to debug and resolve production issues. 
> - Consequently, relative time invested in on-call goes up.
