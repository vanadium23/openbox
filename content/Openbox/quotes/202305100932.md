> Red Flag: Shallow Module
A shallow module is one whose interface is complicated relative to the functionality it provides. Shallow modules donâ€™t help much in the battle against complexity, because the benefit they provide (not having to learn about how they work internally) is negated by the cost of learning and using their interfaces. Small modules tend to be shallow.
