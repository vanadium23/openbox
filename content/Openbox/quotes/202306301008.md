> The worst teams walk away from problems like these. In good teams, the boss eventually deals with problem behavior. In the best teams, every team member is part of the system of accountability. If team members see others violate a team agreement, they speak up immediately and directly. Itâ€™s dangerous to wait for or expect the boss to do what good teammates should do themselves.
