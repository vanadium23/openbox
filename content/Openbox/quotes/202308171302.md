> When Fred Brooks wrote that there were no order-of-magnitude gains, he missed something. There may not be any 10x gains, but there are certainly 10x losses. I have seen organizations that were hamstrung by their approach to software development, sometimes by technology, more often by process. I once consulted in a large organization that hadnâ€™t released any software into production for more than five years.
