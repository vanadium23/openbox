> How do we integrate the work from separate streams of development? If you are as nerdy as me, this may be ringing bells; this is about something deeply fundamental. This is about information and concurrency. When you have independent streams of information, the cost of bringing them together to form a coherent whole can be extremely high if there is any overlap. The best way to parallelize things is to do it in a way where there is no need to re-integrate (nine babies).
