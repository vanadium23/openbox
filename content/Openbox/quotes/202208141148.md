> The habit of testing and correcting the concept by its consequences in experience has been the spring within the movement of our civilization ever since. In science and in art and in self-knowledge we explore and move constantly by turning to the world of sense to ask, Is this so? This is the habit of truth, always minute yet always urgent, which for four hundred years has entered every action of ours; and has made our society and the value it sets on man, as surely as it had made the linotype machine and the scout knife, and King Lear and the Origin of Species and Leonardo’s Lady with a Stoat.
